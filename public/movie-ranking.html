<h1>Best Movies According to Ebenezer</h1>
<h2>My top 3 (three) movies of all time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Across the River</h3>
<p>It is an epic action movie.<br />
 It tells the real life story of Delico Nwa Mama.<br />
 A notorious criminal who seemed impossible to apprehend. He terrorized Nigeria in the 19's to early 2000.
</p>

<h3>Ije (The Journey) </h3>
<p>It is an interesting Nigerian movie that tells the story of Anya, an upcoming female singer married to an American billionare. <br />
 She was being accused of killing her husband and two other men.<br />
 She would prefer going to jail than coming out with the truth that her husband and the other men violently raped her repeatedly due to the cultural and societal stigma Nigerian society place on rape.
</p>

<h3>Breathe of Life </h3>
<p>Breathe of Life is a Nigeria movie that talks about having strong faith in God despite passing or having passed through harsh tribulations
